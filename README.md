Java Console Calculator
This project is a simple calculator application written in Java, which runs on the console. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features
User-Friendly Menu: Choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exit.

Input Handling: Uses Javaâ€™s Scanner class to read user input from the console.

Multiple Calculations: Operates in a loop, letting users perform as many calculations as they want until they choose to exit.

Error Checking: Handles division by zero with an appropriate error message.

Modular Code: Each operation is implemented as a separate method for clarity and reusability.

How It Works
The user selects an operation from the menu.

The calculator prompts for two numbers.

The selected operation is performed, and the result is displayed.

The user can continue performing more calculations or exit the application.

Outcome:
This project helps understand basic Java console I/O, methods, loops, and logical flow in Java programming.
